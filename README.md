## This Repository

This repository contains the source code for the [Overwatch SR Tracker](https://www.google.com.mx/?gfe_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=-7eDWu_dFuqr8we4loEY) app.

The branching strucutre is [explained here](https://gist.github.com/digitaljhelms/4287848), 
always branch off master as master reflects the latests development code.

- new features and issues must branch off master (with the naming topic-*) as master accept merges from this branches.
- Hotfixes must branch of stable (hotifx-*), as stable reflects the latest code in production and it can accept merges from hotfixes.
- topic-* branches must merge to master and deleted when work has been done, another topic-* branches must merge the master changes into them to keep working on them.

## Architecture

This app uses the **Model View Presenter** *(MVP)* architectural pattern
using the [@AlfredoBejarano implementation *(SimpleMVP)*](https://github.com/AlfredoBejarano/AndroidSimpleMVP) implementation.

Birefly, this implementation consist in using only three layers for a feature, those being:
- Model     - Any DTO / POJO class.
- View      - A class that *Only and only* handles data drawing and user interactions, data processing is handled by the *Presenter*.
- Presenter - This layer handles data processing, it usually runs on another thread and report this data changes in the main thread for a view to draw it.

A fourth layer is used globaly for defining where the data is located *(repository layer)*, in local database this is
accessed with a Presenter class.

In a server *(let's say, an API)* it's different, the **Repository class** is an interface that is defined using the **Retrofit API definitions**
and specifies what data the presenter needs to send.

*A view draws in the paper as the presenter handles crayons to it, if you force someone to do the other's job, you are doing it wrong*
